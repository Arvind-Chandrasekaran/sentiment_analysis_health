Merely 4 days after receiving the covid vaccine I was hospitalized for seizures at the age of 22. Every doctor,neurologist, and rheumatologist shrugs and says we have no idea what’s going on. I was healthy and never went to the hospital before getting the vaccine. Now I’m in the ICU on a ventilator monthly with psoriatic rashes all over my body from my own immune system attacking my body,joints, and brain. Never in my life had I had a seizure nor any autoimmune disorder. Please be careful if you are planning on getting this vaccine.

1j0aovf,"I'm pregnant with my first child. I'm not provax or antivax, I sit somewhere in the middle. I posted in antivax and got some good advice but also biased. So I'm here to get some more potentially biased comments (but on the other extreme). Please be respectful as I just want to make the best decision for my child. Please don't tell me to stop being selfish or to do my research (I spend hours a day researching this stuff) Here we go:

I believe vaccines can save lives. I also believe that big pharma is trying to make us all sick for profit. I believe that vaccines have side effects. I don't believe all vaccines are necessary. I believe certain ingredients in vaccines make your immune system weaker. So after countless hours of reading books about vaccines, the risk and benefits of each. Here's where I stand:

Vaccines where I lean more towards not giving:
- Heb B - my baby will not be having sex or doing drugs. I will reconsider this vaccine when they are a teenager.
- Rotavirus - mild disease, chance of dying is so small, they will fight it off just fine.
-DTaP - I've heard horror story side effects with this vaccine, the only disease I'm concerned with is pertussis. I understand it can be dangerous to children. I will be a stay at home mom and they will be homeschooled. If they get the slightest cough, straight to the doctor to get tested and get antibiotics. 
- Polio - they will receive only if we travel somewhere with polio 
- Influenza - strands change every year, I've never had the flu and have not received my shot in years.
- Hep A - there's like no chance of getting Hep A in the US, and if you do get it, the chance of dying is small.
- Varicella - maybe as a teen, but everyone had chicken pox 20 years ago and over 50% of people who died from it were adults, so maybe they get the vaccine later.
- HPV - not really concerned about this infection, preventable with proper sex education, vaccine has too many risks.

Vaccines I lean more towards yes:
- Hib - I think benefits of this vaccines outweighs the extremely small risks. I will delay until 6 months.
-PCV - same reason as HIB. Will also delay until 6 months but will not give at same time as Hib. 
- MMR - Will not give this before 5 years old, the side affects are too big of a risk. These are mild diseases for children and vitamin A is proven to fight against these (especially measles). My child will be taking beef liver as soon as they start solids which is the best source of vitamin A. 
- MCV4 - wouldn't need until they are older anyway and vaccine is pretty safe. 

I would like actual useful information, not just to be told I'm dumb and a terrible parent and you hope my kid does (I've heard it all, bullying me isn't going to make me vaccinate my kid). Post some articles that I should read that would maybe shift my perspective. If you did not vaccinate or only partially vaccinated, tell me if you have any regrets and why. Am I completely wrong with everything I said? Do you agree with anything I said? Is there something I'm missing?

Edit: well this was kind of successful, kind of not. I have not made up my mind, I was just wanting additional resources. All this did was remind me that I am not allowed to think for myself or else I am a terrible mother. Thank you to those who ACTAULLY took the time to provide me with some articles to read, I am reconsidering some of my original thoughts (so I thought you guys would like that but apparently not). Since you guys are so science based, I encourage you to have a discussion with someone who disagrees with you since it's obvious you guys are in your own little bubble. If you are so supportive of vaccines, barking at me won't make me change my mind, those of you who were respectful were the ones I listened to :)",

19e7tu6,"****Edit: HUGE thanks to everyone for the resources and advice so far, I have read every comment. I am now highly considering therapy as a jumping off point for this situation as well as being more direct with my parents about how uncomfortable I feel when they disrespect my parenting choices. I already feel much less scared of the upcoming pediatric appointments. Blessings! 



I’m a first time mom seeking resources and scholarly studies regarding the safety of vaccines. As a child my siblings and I  were fully vaccinated but in recent years my hyper-conservative parents have become terrified of them….just in time for my son to be born. He is now 8 months old and I am constantly lectured about how “unsafe” vaccines are. Every issue he could have is “because of those shots” and they’ve even insinuated that if he ever receives an autism diagnosis that I will regret my choice to vaccinate him. My husband and I both got vaccinated for Covid while I was pregnant and they say that my baby’s low birth weight is because I was vaccinated during pregnancy. 

I obviously extremely disagree with this, however I can’t help but feel anxiety and guilt with every pediatric appointment as well as extreme fear that he will be injured or killed by the vaccinations or that I did damage by getting the Covid vaccine. My parents will probably never change their minds but I need some way to put my fears to rest with my son’s 9 month appointment approaching. 

 I am looking for solid studies that prove that standard vaccinations (such as Tdap, MMR, etc.) are safe and effective. Any advice on dealing with parents that think all studies are a sham welcome also…. Please help!",

- August Booster (final stereo version): https://www.patreon.com/posts/august-2024-109636512

Stacked all those 3 boosters using Audacity and I added my SP affirmation in low volume that I almost can't hear on the 4th track. I only use 1 affirmation repeated over and over: ""I am in a happy romantic relationship with [My SP's name]"" - without speeding it up, layering, nor changing the pitch.

The first few days of listening made me feel bliss, very peaceful, lightheaded, almost like I'm floating.

The exact 9 days after listening to that, my SP confessed that she's been having feelings for me and asked me to be her boyfriend. It is truly a MIRACLE.

I listened to the bundle 1-2 hours each day and overnight without listening to other subs.

""According to the Gates’ family physician: “I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you that he refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle.""

""Gates said his children didn't need vaccines, but isn't the whole world educated otherwise? Doesn't the CDC inform us all that babies are born with weak, compromised immune systems and must have 50 vaccines before age 7, or they'll most likely die from infectious diseases? Isn't that the narrative?""

""Here's more on Bill Gates' opinion on vaccines, as shared by his own physician from the seminar: “*They were beautiful kids, truly wise and lively, and he stated they would be fine as they were; they didn’t need any shots.*”

On October 16, 2024, the Leeuwarden District Court announced that it does indeed have jurisdiction to hear the case against Gates.

The billionaire was represented in court by a lawyer from PelsRijcken but did not attend the September 18 hearing in person. His legal team’s defense crumbled when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.

One of the seven plaintiffs has reportedly died since the initial filing, leaving six others to carry on the fight against Gates and his cohorts. These ordinary Dutch citizens, whose identities have been redacted from the court documents, say they trusted the vaccine narrative and are now paying the price.

The plaintiffs referenced various public statements made by Gates, including a widely viewed YouTube video from April 2020 titled [“The Race for a COVID-19 Vaccine, Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1AQ5EXcJYc),” as part of their evidence.

\*As Gates has been protected and supported by many in high positions for decades, I dont expect a conviction of anything.  I merely shared that 7 people had the courage to take a stand for their human rights and thats more than many do.

She is obsessed with the idea that vaccines cause everything from autism to death and is terrified of my baby getting her two month vaccines. She's accepted that we will still vaccinate our child and is now pushing the idea of spreading the vaccines, or dropping ones she thinks are unnecessary: PCV, HIB, rototeq.

After hearing many anecdotal anti-vax stories from her, I said she was welcome to send me peer reviewed studies. She sent the below studies and I was curious if anyone has ideas on why they are flawed.

1j4fo6b,"I had a wet-coughing, sneezing, nose dripping lady sit next to me.  I asked her quite civily if she would consider wearing a mask.  She immediately went off on a loud ""you have no right"" tirade and pushed the call button. I was reprimanded by the FA for just making such a request...  ""You CANNOT ask another passenger to mask up!"" I was reseated to a middle seat near the toilets in steerage and the lady took over my econ plus aisle seat (my spouse was left across the aisle from her and caught a similar cold a few days later--coincidence?!)  After I was reseated, a large enforcer came on the plane to ask me ""are you going to be a problem?"" My new seatmates must have wondered what minor felony I must have committed.  Even mild mannered million milers can still learn something new every boarding.

EdIt:  I had no idea this submission would take off as it has.  
To answer many comments, yes we masked up after she sat down and started coughing and sneezing.  So did another person near us.  While reaching for masks, I offered her a spare, asked if she'd consider wearing it -- that's apparently what it to to light her fuse and when I was loudly told I had ""no right to ask..."" -- which, apparently, the FA concurs with. 

Many of the comments indicate it was rude for me to even ask and offer. I guess we just disagree. Civil society is under stress.

I didn't think it important to mention it, but with many pointing to this being a peculiarly American issue, I'll just add without being more specific that the coughing passenger was from Eastern Europe.

Several others believe there must have been much more to the story and just don't believe another passenger would go off immediately like this without more provocation.  Several others have seen similar reactions and believe.  I understand the skepticism -- I am aware of mask politics, but it startled me how quickly she went to anger and her choice to hit the call button rather than simply declining. Maybe she was having a terrible day.

I understand coughing, sneezing and nose blowing may be due to allergies or other afflictions.  I would have been comforted had she just said, ""I have allergies.""  My spouse has athsma and allergies, and my father's terrible COPD likely contributed to his death.  Masking oneself is not as effective as masking onself and having a considerate person that is coughing and sneezing do the same. My wife masks up in confined public spaces (and often in nature) when allergies hit; she believes when she has sneezing fits it's a considerate thing to do even if her allergies aren't infectious.

I imagine the FA has dealt with similar situations and wanted to nip this in the bud.  I understand why she reseated me, and perhaps there were no similar seats in plus (the flight was near maximum loading), so it may not have been an intentional choice to issue a less valuable seat. What we do not understand is why an enforcer was called in to ask if I was going to be a problem with zero effort to engage me even briefly in a conversation. The choice I was given was for having the temerity to inquire about masking and to offer one up was to move to the open seat or deplane. Given my neighbor's reaction, the FA likely didn't want to risk a situation of us remaining together even if I did want to stay.  Given some of the crazy passenger antics of late, I understand. 

As for contacting UA and demanding an apology or compensation, I would appreciate if a UA employee could advise whether the FA handled this per policy -- and whether either the complainer or I already have some notes in the file.  Regardless, given the million plus of you that have viewed this, I think my point may have been taken by someone in charge.

Now many people know that the N95 is an old model of [Nokia phone](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b-yOPpTzL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg), but it's also a type of [mini computer](https://www.amazon.com/PELADN-3200Mhz-Desktop-Computer-Support/dp/B0CSPBS85H?th=1). 

Next, Wifi [Cellebrite](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b-yOPpTzL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg). Cellebrite is a tool used to collect digital evidence. 

Based on this, it seems likely that Drake's house is/was rigged up with a mini-PC running Cellebrite to capture network data. 

Now, the headset and the beeps. The [SteelSeries Arctis 7 Wireless Headset](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Lossless-Wireless-Headset-Headphone/dp/B07G176F76?th=1) is a very popular one that, when I bought it in 2019, was one of the highest rated for someone looking to spend a decent amount. Lotta professional gamers or streamers use it (this speaks to the possibility of Drake having one). There are many different models, but I'd venture to guess that they use the same beeping sounds across all their devices. 

This is a wireless headset that works over your wifi network. Imagine Drake is paranoid about using phones and decides to use the mic/""Mike"" on his headset to start doing his business and the wifi hub was already compromised...


Onto the beeps themselves. They're faint, but they stick out to me every time because I've heard those sounds a thousand times. I've provided a clip with the section and listed the timestamps for both the Spotify and YouTube versions so y'all can tell me what you year. Hopefully at least one of you has a SteelSeries headset. Bonus points if anyone can link a stream or picture of Drake using one. 


Here's the clip

1iq008t,"First an explanation of what Search Engine Optimization is, as some people have asked:

SEO is Search Engine Optimization. So like, Drake might make a song called ""baby girl"" so when you search ""Drake baby girl"" you get webpages talking about that instead of talking about ""meet the grahams""

Probably wouldn't work with ""meet the grahams"" because of all the discourse, but works very well with things less known.

So Drake makes ""toosie slide"" so when you search ""Drake toosie"" you get that, instead of gossip about a sketchy scenario.

But as Kendrick noted, ""can't toosie slide out of this one, it's just going to resurface.""

Somewhat related, some people say Disney made ""frozen"" to steer people away from Walt Disney being ""cryogenically frozen"" and assorted weirdness.

With that explained, I wanted to open this up for a discussion about where people think Drake is doing this. I think particularly with an eye towards the new album, and while I haven't given a listen (and probably won't), just looking at lyrics can be helpful here.

I think this is important, as it has the potential to show us the areas where Drake is trying to hide something, and thus the best places to dig.

I think some have speculated the song ""Nokia"" is an attempt at this with the whole ""n95_wifi_cellebrite"" thing relating to ""Nokia"" (I imagine most of the uninitiated would search the latter, trying to find out more information on the topic.)",

1hh344v,"First time posting but I’ve had quite a few dms about public health (PH) training lately, so for ease I’m making this post to answer the most common questions I've received. For context I started the programme after taking a few years break from training post-foundation.

My Experience

Day-to-day: I am now completing a PH MSc but before this was based in local authority (LA). Typically my day-to-day was quite academic and I worked from home most days. It was very project driven and very much desk-based. The specifics of my work depended on the project I was working on but involved things like report writing, data analysis, evaluation work and stakeholder engagement. 



Pros:

* Large-scale impact - what we do can make a really big difference for a lot of people which brings me satisfaction in a way that clinical med didn’t
* Career flexibility - It’s really easy to go OOP to explore our interests e.g. working overseas in a global health capacity. I also enjoy having more freedom to decide my placements in the later stages so that they match my professional goals
* Autonomy - I really enjoy having so much more freedom to structure my time day-to-day
* Respect - I find that there is a lot more professional respect and far less infantilisation from employees in PH
* Location flexibility - I regularly work from home which I really enjoy after years of long commutes
* Low stress: the most stressful day in PH is laughable compared to a weekend of ward cover
* Supportive programme: as a small specialty it feels very personable. Relationships between TPDs and trainees are positive and it feels like there is a genuine desire to help us succeed
* Work-life balance - I have no issues getting annual leave, if I have an appointment during the day it’s a non-issue for me to attend, etc.



Neutral:

* No patient contact: I can see this as a con for some but while it was strange at first, I personally no longer mind
* No on-calls for the first couple of years: this is nice for free time but it does impact our take-home pay
* Lack of recognition: most of the general public don't even realise that public health is a specialty, and most other doctors don’t really understand what we do.
* Non-medics on the programme: I personally don't mind given how broad the specialty is, and because they need extensive and relevant work experience to qualify. They also go through the same assessment process and training to become a consultant. I do however, know that this may be an issue for some. 
* Progression: we progress through training by signing off a number of learning outcomes in key areas. There is no specific target each year so the onus is on the trainee to make sure that they are making sufficient progress through these. This is great for some people since once we’ve ticked off the boxes we really can do whatever you like in terms of placements but it can be challenging for those that need a more structured approach to progress, and it may result in more limited options for them later down the line.



Cons:

* Difficulty switching off: it's very easy to work late when I'm involved in an ongoing project, especially when working from home so often
* Not always seeing the outcome of our work: given its longitudinal nature we may have moved onto a new placement before seeing the end of something we’ve spent a good amount of time on which may leave some pople with a sense of incompletion
* Our work may be disregarded which may make it feel like a waste of our time (not personally experienced this but I have heard of it happening which would be understandably very frustrating).

For me though, the pros far outweigh the cons and overall I am really happy in the specialty.



General Details

Application process:

* Experience: If you are interested in getting PH experience you can consider getting in touch with the PH TPDs in your region, arranging a taster day/week or even getting in touch with your nearby LA or health protection team (HPT) to see if there are any opportunities. It’s also worth keeping an eye out for one of the deanery online information evenings that are held throughout the year (usually advertised on the PH webpage of the respective deanery). These can be very helpful as a prospective applicant, not just for learning more about the specialty but also for meeting other applicants and forming study groups for the assessment centre, etc. That being said, experience is not essential for the Oriel application as it's just a tickbox process for medic applicants - no white space questions or scoring involved. 
* Assessment Centre: The assessment centre involves 3 different exams - RANRA (numerical reasoning), Watson Glaser (critical thinking) and a SJT, and you need to meet the cut off score for each exam. The JobTestPrep website is a great resource for Watson Glaser and RANRA but rubbish for SJT. I found using my old foundation SJT practice papers and Pastest far more useful - the SJT principles are similar, you just need to apply them to a PH context in the assessment centre. 
* Interview: The Medical Interviews book that everyone uses for CST/HST works very well for structuring general motivation and teamwork types of questions, but for me the additional knowledge that really helped came from speaking to PH SpRs and consultants who helped me better understand how to structure my answers to PH-themed questions in an effective way. Having an idea of the main hot topics in PH was also very useful.



Training pathway:

* The first stage of training involves a compulsory placement in LA focusing on health improvement, and one with a HPT as part of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) focusing on health protection. Health protection work is quite different to local authority work and closer to a clinical role in that you are given cases of outbreaks/ communicable diseases and make decisions on containment e.g. vaccinations, contact tracing etc. Disease surveillance is also another aspect of this role. 
* If you don't already have a MSc public health then you are also required to complete this full-time during stage 1 but it is fully-funded and you still receive your salary. 
* The first stage of training lasts around 1.5-2.5yrs, after which you have a lot of flexibility to select placements according to your interests. There are 2 professional exams to pass, the DFPH and the MFPH with the idea being that you pass these during stage 1 of training. On-calls are a part of training, generally starting once you have completed your health protection placement and passed the DFPH. It tends to be NROC in nature.
* It’s a bit harder to comment specifically on what placements in stage 2 are like because as mentioned above there are a wide range of options, but examples include working in central government (e.g. OHID), the NHS, The Kings Fund, NICE, academia, NIHR, NGOs like MSF… there are a mix of deanery-based placement options as well as national placements that are open to anyone in training, regardless of their deanery.



Job prospects:

* A bit harder for me to comment on specifics at this stage but it depends on where you want to work. Most PH consultants go into LA  to do health improvement work or join a HPT. It’s worth noting that LAs may pay less than UKHSA roles as they have more flexibility to decide salaries, whereas the UKHSA pay according to the standard consultant pay scale. Academia is also quite common as well as NHS work (this branch of PH is known as healthcare public health). For careers a bit off-piste e.g. global health, WHO, private industry, more prep for these would likely be beneficial in the later stages of training to gear your CV towards them but it’s very doable. There is also a push to make global health more equitable for people who can't travel so easily e.g. through hybrid work where you are based between the UK and overseas rather than exclusively working internationally.


Hopefully this answers the majority of questions!

1jgm4sq,"Hello! I have just found out I did not get through the interview stage of the PH application. I really struggled with the interview, despite doing a lot of prep I clearly was not prepping effectively or efficiently. I had a good trawl of previous posts on here, and thought I did a thorough search of resources online but on the day felt completely out of my depth. I also used the CT/ST interview skills book which was good though I found it a little medical training specific. For instance, a lot of the questions were PH scenario based, but the questions in the CT/ST interview skills book understandably tend to be more medical scenarios that are less PH applicable. 

I accept that some of that was nerves and the format being new to me, and next year I need to do more practice interviews. However, I was wondering if anyone knows of any helpful online resources or books that are more PH specific?

So I am currently employed as a Project Manager equivalent in the tech industry. I have been there for almost 5 years and it's been good for the most part, but between the state of the industry (mass redundancies, pay cuts, no promotions in over a year for anyone in the team) and the fact that my workplace operates in a different timezone than the UK has made me consider a career change. 

I didn't really end up in the tech industry by passion, I got the job through some connections during lockdown, and progressed pretty fast as I am a fast learner and liked the company and the team. 

The thing is, I don't see any future in this company and I don't feel stable in an industry that threatens to collapse every 6-10 months. I'm tired of being afraid to lose my livelihood especially as this seems to be mostly dependent on decisions that aren't always rooted in reality (vaporous speculations about the impact of AI etc) and don't take people in consideration enough. 

I have been doing some research to move my project management skills to another industry, and stumbled upon positions related to Health and Safety or with an aspect connected to it. I have always been interested in Health and Safety, part of what I studied in Univeristy is related to it, and a lot of my relatives seem to think that it would be a good fit for me. 

However, I don't really know how to make that move?   
I am going to pursue a NEBOSH certification next month while working (I don't think I will be leaving my current job until I secure another position). But every job I see advertised as entry level requires experience in a specific field (construction, engineering, food safety, etc) which I don't have. I can't really take up an apprenticeship or volunteering positions, because I can't be without an income.   
Is it totally unreasonable for me to consider that move? Has anyone here made a career change to health and safety from a somewhat unrelated field? How did that go? Does anybody have any advice? ",

For me, it's the internal changes and still mourn over the person I used to be. 

On the outside I'm doing fine, I've made decent career progress and am proud of that, on paper am doing much better than pre-pandemic.
Yet internally have never felt the same. I used to be a super positive person, and even early on in the pandemic was so resilient and made the most of every opportunity that came with the changes. But over time I got worn out. I used to carry such an energy about me which dwindled away in the pandemic. I lost my drive and my resilience.My self-confidence has completely nose-dived and I mourn a lot over the personality I used to have.

1jm8ug6,"I am having a blast, don't get me wrong. 

You can't technically lose, and you also can kinda make anything (but also you're not incentivised to). 

But my point is that as a SuperString you have not much to do but, pick a place, sit down, and try and shoot as much as you can before the inevitable infection. 

You can't do much, the maps are considerably small and most of the ""best"" characters (debatable) are like ""you can get here safe"" (Leona playing minecraft) or ""Shhhh, you don't see me"" + ""Now you die"" (Yvette cosplaying League of Legends Teemo) 

The most plausible thing would be to give SuperString a bit more of stats. But I think new objectives and maybe on a bigger map could be interesting, in case Outbreak comes back (I assume it's a temporary mode, as I am a nooby). 

Maybe not making the SuperString remain sat down in place, but getting them around, doing tasks, taking Deviants off or something. 

Before playing I thought this game mode would be more like a PVE horde thing. Well it is, but it's PVP and being a SuperString is kinda lame compared to running around at the speed of light. 

But as it remains, I don't see players playing Outbreak outside the event, you can only get so far with the fun of being SuperString for 3 seconds before going beast mode. 

. 

Honestly, they could even lean full on this monster thing and do a horror mode based on this. But this is going astray of the topic (but it could be so cool if they made a survive mode, like 4 players against one beefed up player, get inspiration on things like Alien Isolation, Friday the 13th the game, a hide and seek game mode but full on horror, would be so awesome)

1jn2tk4,"So it's probably best you don't pick Leona if your intention is going to be to build a block tower to be away from the ground because your own teammates will shoot your blocks out for no reason at all other than to grief you and allow you to get killed. 

Also I'm not talking about the pre-round where someone might be the ""infected"" before the round starts.(I would obviously do that if I knew that I was going to be infected when the game started That's a different topic) 

I'm talking about during  the game when the round already has begun and the infected were chosen, while I'm standing on it I'm seeing my own teammates shooting it out. 

I have no idea why this is a thing teammates should not be able to shoot out Leona's blocks. 


If that was the case then everybody else's traps could get destroyed by your own teammates

Of course I am reporting it when I see it but I don't think it's going to go too far to be honest probably just not going to play as Leona anymore during that mode.

**EDIT**

I also want to make this abundantly clear I'm not talking about using Leona's blocks to go up to exploited bug spots that anybody should not be able to get to. 

I'm only talking about Just a straight upward tower that isn't blocking or obstructing anybody's path and totally out of the way. 

Trust me I fully understand if there's a Leona blocking avenues or lanes that you need to get to to jump to I would 100% shoot those blocks out too.


**EDIT 2**
I can't believe I have to explain this but I've only played outbreak one day since the update and I already understand how to defeat Leona's upward Tower strat. 

Very simple guys, if you have an omega crystalline, better yet if you have a second one that's awakened even better, most teams do if I'm not mistaken, All you literally have to do is shoot the range attack at the blocks and they will blow up with just one shot. And it will take a group of them. NOT just a single block. 

I know this because I've had this strategy defeated because of that I had a 10 block high tower, two omega's shot their range attacks at it, And voila, I glided across the map to try to run away and I got killed. 

So please don't come here and tell me that it's impossible.

Also, if the omegas on your team are not using their ranged abilities to blow the blocks up then why don't you get on your mics and say something or type in the chat, And if they're not doing that then I really don't know what to tell you because the tower strat that Leona uses is not impossible to defeat it's so easy because I've died from it from the Omega shooting the blocks and causing me to go glide to run for my life.

Over a week ago, I posted about some questions that I had about a virus called “Expiro.DD!MTB”.

I thought that I had gotten rid of the virus after wiping my pc but it’s still there? (At least I think it’s the same virus).

I’m 90% sure that I didn’t get this from suspicious downloads because my new installation of windows was very sluggish and a few features weren’t working even before I downloaded any programs. Plus, the two programs that I did download was from legit websites (Brave and bit defender)

Did this happen because I reinstalled windows locally? (I couldn’t do a cloud reinstall) Should I do a clean reinstall from an usb instead?

(Sorry for the shitty pic)

Tried to download ghost of tsushima from fitgirl. The setup.exe didn't work, but it says on fitgirl website to download the 2nd fixed installer in that case, so I did that. Then I got this warning. I know it could be a false positive, but I've never had this kind of warning on a fitgirl download, so I am kind of sus. Do you think it could be an actual backdoor? [Here](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut/) is the link to the page I downloaded from.",

1djtrjn,"People are still getting Covid **obviously**, and are getting sick with it, but it seems no more than a normal cold. The latest ICU figure (with zero restrictions in life and vaccines that have likely since lost their efficacy) is just 14. And I assume some of those people are in ICU with Covid, not because of Covid. The peak was 221 in early 2021 with vaccines and restrictions. From early January to late March 2024, 130 people died, with the average age being 82-85 (again, it doesn't specify if they died from Covid or just with Covid).

In general, life has gone back to normal. I rarely see someone wearing a mask, people don't isolate if sick, I don't even know when I last heard some say the word Covid. Is Covid-19 finally over and life back to how it was pre-2020\*, do you think?

\*I mean for the vast majority of people - I don't mean to dismiss those who are vulnerable and have added Covid to their least of worries on top of their pre-2020 list.",

1j9sqf6,"i have a cyst thats been here since august. it’s now causing my problems. it was first the size of a large under the skin pimple & now its the size of two large grapes. i’ve stop shaving, started a more intimate hygiene routine for down there. 

now the cyst is turning purple and i cannot walk. 

unfortunately, i’m in a horrible financial situation (details not important, i don’t need financial advice) so i’m doing everything i can to take care of this at home and avoid going to the doctor. 

what are some recommendations for both cyst care & prevention? 

EDIT: maybe 3 hours after posting this it ended up popping in the shower and i took precautions cleaning it, draining it and keeping an eye on it by keeping it clean with frequent sitz baths. 

its been 2 days after posting this but now i am getting my period (after not having my period for over 1.5 year since i have an iud). 

is this normal!?!? ",
1ff7nqo,"Hello, people! 

So, I'm currently going through a bedbug scare. The hotel me and my bf had been staying might have had them, in what I pressume was an early stage infestation because I couldn't find any of the critters or their signs (no droppings, no spots no shells, no smell, no nothing) save for a few suspicious bites (tho we had 3 mosquitos in our room but the bites are suspicious bc they're in clusters and bc my body reacts differently to mosquitos bites). I have found bites on my face, arms and neck. My bf doesn't have any but we suspect he was bitten to. 

When we got home we bagged everything in garbage bags, took them on the balcony, and let them in the sun ~~to boil~~ while we took a shower and shoved the clothes on us in the washing machine. We're currenly washing everything that's washable at a 90°C, 2 hrs and a half cycle. We sprayed rubbing alcohol or everything that was electronics, documents and couldn't be put in the washing machine.

We don't have a dryer, so what should we do with the unwashable backpack (it has an usb cable incorporated among other things) and our shoes? 
Also, is there anything else we can do to keep the little suckers away from our home?

Thanks!

Tl;dr: there's a chance the hotel we were staying had bedbugs, we quarantined everything on the open balcony, in plastic bags, in the sun and we are washing our clothes in 90°c, 2 hrs cycles. We sprayed alcohol on the unwashable things like electronics, wallets etc.
What should we do with our shoes and an unwashable backpack if we don't have a dryer? Any other prevention steps we should take?

1idpr87,Has anyone been successful or found a combination of things that work to prevent any future cysts. Any combination of foods and lifestyle changes that have helped curb any future flare ups? Castor oil? Consistently doing sitz baths regardless of if the cyst is swollen or not?🥲…not sure if surgery is for me as I’m also currently on blood thinners 🥲🥲…sorry if this question has been asked already on here. Just desperate to get as much info on one place as possible that’s not related to surgery…,

1ih49km,This challenge is genuinely harder than getting to round 100 💀,
1h3g2vk,"In the opening clip I get hit my Vermin that I didn't even know was there. That sucked 

Got to rd 19 and took a Mangler blast to the face while trying to zip line. 

The challenge required sheer perfection. I been trying for this challenge the entire week but something always went wrong. Dead slides, packet burst into zombie damage(again, why do I have to connect to a server to play solo?) getting hit my the vending machine blast with melee macchiato.

Time and time again I slowly inched closer and closer like the worm that I am. 

It was finally completed today and I can finally endure the next prestige. 

""My"" method which is just a method posted both on here and on YouTube with only a very slight variation.

I used the ASG shotgun(might got the gun name wrong) with dragon breath. I also used energy mine with the turret augment and the duration extender augment. You can have what appears to be three Max and they can last multiple rounds. 

For the first few rounds maybe near 7-8. I just trained zombies in the starting area. Once I had enough points I went through Liberty Lanes and went to the church to try and pack. Getting the Napalm ammo mod with the damage to big elite and I think longer burn duration.

I used the helmet Easter egg around 9 or 10 to get rare wrench and some extra points. 

On vermin rounds I went into motor Lodge since yje lil Spidey Bois only go through the front door. 

Then I utilized the roof and zip line strategy. I would place an EM on top and on the mid section and is I could get a third, I would put it at the bottom so all three levels are covered. 

Then I would go behind the Zipline to the edge and just aim my shotgun at the ladder and kill zombies that were coming off the rooftop while killing the ones in the bottom. 

The manglers were the second most dangerous enemies of they spawned and charged up and got a blast off. So I would use the zip line to reset the zombie spawns. Once I got an elite spawn at the bottom I would clean up the manglers. 

Now I wanted to have enough salvage to get a CG to clear the abomination rounds. I was not fortunate enough to get this in the successful run with the Helmet EE.

So it was a lot of going back and forth on the zip lines and killing zombies. Supposedly this can respawn the abomination. 

Yet, no luck for me. So I just had to manage through round after round avoiding the Mangler. 

I also did the bowling EE in hopes of getting something good each time. I never did. 

I also picked up the water valve because there were t times zombies just stopped spawning. So had to do the main EE in LL to get them to spawn again. 

Needless to say, this was a hard challenge but I'm glad it's done. 

I would have certainly cheesed it with the joining a friend's game at 19 but that was patched. Also saving and quitting from the match supposedly works but be aware because I didn't know, if you do the vending machine EE with melee macchiato this actually still counts as a hit but you can't tell because you can't see anything. 

Only got it from the random perk gobble gun. Only perks you really need is Stamina Up (with fall damage augment) and Speed Cola. 

Just got a few more dark ops here in zombies to go and they're probably going to be very difficult. XD",
